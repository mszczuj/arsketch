my code assumes that you have additional camera connected to usb
dependencies: -lcv -lcvaux -lARToolKitPlus
last one is taken from here: https://launchpad.net/~rojtberg/+archive/ppa/

compile & run:

1. run cmake-gui - choose build dir, click configure, click generate (choose Makefile)
2. cd you_build_path
3. make install
4. make 
5. create ogre.cfg in your_build_path/dist/bin/ or use mine from dist/bin
